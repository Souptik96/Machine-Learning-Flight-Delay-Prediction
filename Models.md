## # Models Used in Flight Delay Prediction

## Introduction
In the "Flight Delay Prediction" project, we employed a variety of machine learning models to tackle the challenging task of predicting flight delays. Each of these models offers unique strengths and insights into the complex world of flight scheduling and delays. Here, we provide an overview of the models used and their performance in the project.

## XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
**Overview:** XGBoost is a powerful ensemble machine learning algorithm known for its speed, efficiency, and predictive accuracy. It uses a gradient boosting framework and is particularly effective in handling complex datasets.

**Application:** In our project, XGBoost was applied to predict flight delays by leveraging its ability to model non-linear relationships and handle large datasets effectively.

## GradientBoosting (Gradient Boosting Classifier)
**Overview:** GradientBoosting is another ensemble learning method that builds an additive model in a forward stage-wise manner. It is based on the gradient descent algorithm and has proven to be effective in various machine learning tasks.

**Application:** We utilized GradientBoosting to predict flight delays due to its robustness and its capability to handle features with varying importance.

## Logistic Regression
**Overview:** Logistic Regression is a classic machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class, making it a fundamental tool in classification problems.

**Application:** In our project, Logistic Regression was employed to predict flight delays by classifying flights as delayed or not delayed, providing a baseline model for comparison.

## Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
**Overview:** The Support Vector Classifier is a classification algorithm that seeks to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes. It is known for its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data.

**Application:** We used SVC to predict flight delays by defining a decision boundary that separates delayed and non-delayed flights based on various features.

## Model Performance
Each of these models was assessed using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting flight delays. The final decision on model selection and deployment was influenced not only by accuracy but also by the model's ability to correctly classify delayed flights, which is of significant importance in the aviation domain.

## Conclusion
The combination of these machine learning models provided valuable insights and predictive power in the context of flight delay prediction. Each model has its unique strengths and weaknesses, and the project's findings emphasize the importance of evaluating models not only based on accuracy but also on their ability to correctly predict delayed flights.

The variety of models used in this project demonstrates the versatility of machine learning in addressing complex real-world problems. It also opens the door to further experimentation and model refinement to achieve even more accurate flight delay predictions.
