# Flight Delay Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the critical task of predicting flight delays, a key concern in modern air travel. We employed machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, GradientBoosting, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC), to explore and tackle the challenges associated with flight delay prediction.

## Key Objectives
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the flight delay dataset for machine learning, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into the dataset by visualizing distributions, relationships between features, and understanding the characteristics of flight delays.

3. **Model Development**: Train, evaluate, and compare four machine learning algorithms, each offering unique perspectives on flight delay prediction. The models considered are XGBoost, GradientBoosting, Logistic Regression, and SVC.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Examine the performance of the models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics. Gain an understanding of the trade-offs and strengths of each model.

5. **Future Improvements**: Recognize that the aviation domain is complex and dynamic, with various external factors impacting flight delays. Explore opportunities for further feature engineering, data enrichment, and external data sources to enhance the models' predictive capabilities.
